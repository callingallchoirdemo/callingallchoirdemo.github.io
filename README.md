See `index.html` for the HTML of the site.

## To-do

Content:

- Add testimonials to front page

- Then, someday, add members area.

Layout:

- Add Members Area, Mark Growden, Contact Us link to the top

- Experiment with header not being sticky

- Center the footer

Notes about content I'm skipping:

- About -> News: Skipped. Nothing there. :)

- Photos: The photos are beautiful, but old. Linking to Instagram is better, in my opinion.
