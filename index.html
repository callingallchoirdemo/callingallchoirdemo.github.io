          The Calling All Choir is a San Francisco community singing
          organization led by founder and artistic director, Mark Growden and
          Assistant Musical Director, Michael Kaulkin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our mission is to provide San Francisco Bay Area communities with a
          self-selecting choral group that performs works that are moving,
          challenging, beautiful, and often fun. Now in its 11th season, our
          choir includes seasoned professionals and devoted amateurs. Members
          range in age from 8 to 80 plus and readily share with each other the
          fun and experience for growing musically.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Calling All Choir was named best choir in the 2015 Oakland
          Magazine “Best of the Bay” issue. The choir performs service sings
          throughout each season for retirement homes, residential treatment
          centers, hospitals, and developmental disability programs. We also
          have a few special shows throughout the season with other choirs,
          cabarets, and other events.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each season we sing a mix of classical, and folkloric music based on a
          theme. Our upcoming season’s theme is
          <em
            >“Knowing She Has Wings – Music by Female Composers and
            Arrangers”</em
          >. Themes from previous seasons include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em
              >“Fire, Tears, and Love Alive – A Celebration of Russian
              Music”</em
            >
          </li>
          <li><em>“The Land of Song – Music of the Baltics”</em></li>
          <li>
            <em
              >“The Blue of our Lakes, The White of our Winters – A Celebration
              of Finnish Music”</em
            >
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We end each Season with Shows at the stunning Mission Dolores
          Basilica. Our performances, like our mission, are community focused
          since we often invite our audiences to sing with us on a song or two.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here’s a list of some pieces we’ve performed in past seasons (you can
          find videos of the choir performing many of these pieces in the CAC
          YouTube channel

      <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
      <div class="relaxed">
        <p><strong>What kind of music do you sing?</strong></p>
        <p>
          We have a different theme each season. Our current season’s theme is
          music by female composers and arrangers and includes works from
          Sweden, the Middle East, the American South, Finland, Germany, and
          more. Some pieces are historic, others contemporary – some are
          “classical” and some are folkloric.
        </p>
        <p><strong>You mean, I don’t have to be a trained singer?</strong></p>
        <p>
          No, although many of our singers are highly trained. Our group
          functions so well because of the mix of skill levels. If you love to
          sing, come sing with us.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Do I need to know how to read music?</strong></p>
        <p>
          It helps, but isn’t required. We provide some music literacy training.
        </p>
        <p><strong> Do you give Concerts?</strong></p>
        <p>
          Yes.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Season Finales</em>: We conclude each season with season finale
          concerts at the Mission Dolores Basilica in San Francisco.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Service Sings</em>: We bring music to underserved groups by
          performing for no fee at venues such as hospitals, retirement homes,
          residential treatment centers, and developmental disability programs.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em> Regional Shows</em>: We are often invited to perform at venues
          around the state.
        </p>

        <p>
          Note: There is no requirement that every member sing in the concerts,
          but we enthusiastically recommend the experience.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Where does the Choir meet?</strong></p>
        <p>
          Rehearsals are held at St. Gregory of Nyssa Church in San Francisco
          (Potrero Hill).

          Known for her musicality and expressive singing, soprano Ann Elizabeth
          Jones is a voice teacher and classical singer based in San Francisco.
          Before moving to California, Ann was based in New York City where she

          and abroad. As a professional choir singer, she has sung under the

          <p>
            Tyler’s professional training is in chemistry with a focus on
            biomolecular mass spectrometry with degrees from Juniata College and
            Boston University. Music has always been a part of his life.
            Although his current emphasis is in group vocal performance and
            melodic jaw harp, past formal musical training has included piano
            and violin. He has sung with several choruses, including the Backbay
            Choral, Mid-Columbia Master Singers, and the San Francisco City
            Chorus. In the arts management sector, he served on the board of the
            San Francisco City Chorus (president and secretary) for five years
            and is currently a primary organizer with the Rathskeller Club
            (immersive theater), Radiant Society (experience design and
            sharing), and the Far Flug Forest (community-driven art retreat).
            Past and semi-ongoing contributions include Noise Weave, Stone Soup,
            Canavan Rally, and the Explorers Guild. As an active amateur
            photographer (http://heibeck.com) he focuses on landscape,
            clandestine art gatherings, night, and travel documentation.

          <h3>Ruth Tringham, Librarian and Board Secretary</h3>
          <p>
            By training and profession Ruth is an archaeologist. She has
            investigated very early farmers (all long dead) all over Eastern
            Europe and, most recently, in Turkey. She came to the US from
            England as part of the so-called “brain drain” and, after an East
            Coast sojourn, ended up very happily in California teaching at UC
            Berkeley. Ever since the technology was available, she has been
            incorporating digital audio-visual media into her research. After
            retiring from teaching a few years ago, she founded with some
            colleagues a non-profit company, the Center for Digital Archaeology.
            Music has always been in her life. She played violin from the age of
            9 until college. She gave up the violin and took up the guitar,
            playing folk songs at excavations wherever she landed up,
            improvising to match the local rhythms and melodies. She didn’t get
            into choral singing until she came to the US, but has continued to
            do that as a passionate part of her life. More at

          <p>
            People have often described Jessica Hobbs as someone trying to lead
            a compulsively artistic life, which is more or less true. She
            started off her adventure in a small Sierra Foothill town and
            eventually meandered her way to the San Francisco Bay Area. Along
            the way Jess has worn many hats; running and creating community art
            programs, counseling teenagers, curating, exhibiting, designing,
            photographing, running a power company, and playing with some girls
            who love lipstick and accelerants. She is an MFA graduate from the
            San Francisco Art Institute and believes collaboration is key in
            community and art. This can be seen through the work of her
            non-profit the FLUX Foundation and her open-source alternative
            energy company All Power Labs.
